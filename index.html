<h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>The Empire hungers for the life force of your flying island in the sky, and will also enslave everyone on it, including you. Now what?</p>
<h2 id="group-organization">Group Organization</h2>
<p>The game group for <strong>Sky Islands</strong> is organized around a single island. Each Island is a full character unto itself, and is capable of communication with other life forms.</p>
<p>It is customary for at least one of the people to be designated the <strong>Game Master</strong>, responsible for thinking of new challenges and twists, while the others in the group are the <strong>Players</strong>. The focus of the game is on a conflict with a known entity, rather than mystery, so it is possible for the position of Game Master to be rotated without losing grasp of the overall storyline.</p>
<p>For a stable group that customarily relies on a single <strong>Game Master</strong> for long periods of time, it is practical for the <strong>Game Master</strong> to introduce deeper mysteries and more complex plots as the campaign goes on. Otherwise, if a group typically has difficulty having a consistent <strong>Game Master</strong>, then it should stick to the war against the Empire, and keep all the larger plot elements to their own characters. The core book intentionally has little lore on anything other than the Empire, to ensure that the entire rest of the world can be mysterious to everyone involved.</p>
<p>A group with no <strong>Game Master</strong> is possible, if there is work put into making the antagonists act and strategize autonomously. This is the basis of some board and card games (which the writer of <strong>Sky Islands</strong> enjoys very much), but less research has been spent on accomplishing this for complex role-playing games such as <strong>Sky Islands</strong>.</p>
<p>Each <strong>Player</strong> is responsible for creating and playing at least one <strong>Player Character</strong>. It is usually difficult for a <strong>Player</strong> to have more <strong>Player Characters</strong> than everyone else while still giving room for the rest of the group to engage in role-playing. It is not impossible, but you need to know your group dynamics well before you allow such a situation.</p>
<p>There is always a risk of one or more <strong>Players</strong> telling others how to design and grow their <strong>Player Characters</strong>. An organized force can be more effective than a mob of individuals doing their own thing, but every single <strong>Player</strong> must be given space and trust to make their own decisions, and practice a bit of creativity.</p>
<h2 id="the-world">The World</h2>
<p>The World’s name, in the language of your Island, is something you need to listen to the Island to find out. Its surface is full of turbulent oceans, jagged crags, opaque fogs, active volcanoes, and shifting deserts. The reasons why so much of the World is this way are deep in your Island’s memory, and it teaches you and your people to never repeat the same mistakes that caused this situation.</p>
<p>There are continents with powerful nations on them, but they sustain themselves through predation and exploitation. They could change their ways and restore the lush forests, swamps and jungles that they once had on their continents, but their destructive systems are too deeply entrenched in their politics. In short, they are perpetuating the mistakes that resulted in the ruined state of the rest of the World. They are exactly what your Island warned you about.</p>
<p>It is up to the Sky Islands to practice the growth of life, and the expansion of life-bearing capacity. But they can only fly so quickly. Your Island is too close to the nation you call The Empire, and that Empire’s military forces creep forward faster than your Island can escape. Now it is time to stand and fight.</p>
<h2 id="the-empire">The Empire</h2>
<p>The Empire uses its magical word system, the Imperial Adtextus, to control life energy flows. It is designed to be overly simplistic, to compress everything down into mere resources for Imperial utilization. Any living being who is subjected to it is inevitably drained to death so that the system can exercise its power against others.</p>
<p>The Adtextus can be considered a mere formalization and systemization of many things the Empire had done prior to its codification. The Empire itself was founded by the act of draining a Sky-Island of its life force in order to keep imperial farming practices functioning for a few more years, rather than actually fix their practices. The proponents of farming technique upgrades were punished by publicly having their life force drained in order to make the senators slightly younger.</p>
<p>Even the senators and emperors are still mutated into shadows of their original selves, sometimes dying young despite draining many of their slaves of life force. Many Sky-Islands and their inhabitants are likewise deformed from mere proximity to the Empire. But if you regain the word system that is sufficiently-complex to describe yourself, then you can be restored.</p>
<p>The Imperial Adtextus is not able to reproduce itself. It relies on Imperials to willingly do that, in exchange for temporary power gained by its practice. This has fueled the Empire into becoming a frightening military power, draining island after island in order to keep going in a zombie state. If left alone then it will surely collapse in on itself, but it keeps on finding new ways to reach other islands and wage war against them.</p>
<h2 id="the-blended-realm">The Blended Realm</h2>
<p>The Blended Realm is so-named because it looks like large swathes of solid colors, which blend together at special edges to create chaotic but beautiful reactions. The solid-color regions are purely of one element, and are home to plants, sentient creatures, spirits, and other things that are purely of that element. They can even be brought back to the solid world with no ill effects, although they can return to their origins in the Blended Realm whenever they wish. If someone uses dirt or other material from the Blended Realm to construct something in the solid world, then they could return at some random time, unless their bound creatures and spirits agree to keep them in the solid realm for a specific amount of time.</p>
<p>The Realm is easily accessible to those outside of the influence of the Imperial Adtextus. Yet it is also quite dangerous, for it morphs and shifts in ways that are not amenable to any way of life that was learned in the solid world. Some sky islands have given up existence in the solid world to land on the Blended Realm, but they are still not immune to the Empire, they merely have gained some terrain advantages. The Empire has specialized auxilia - slave soldiers captured from other islands - who are able to invade the Blended Realm.</p>
<p>The Realm reacts to the health of the solid world. The worse the condition of the islands in the solid world, the more the Blended Realm retreats from it, and the more difficult it is for mortals to shift themselves into the Realm. It is feared that if the Empire were to take over the world, then the Blended Realm would leave forever.</p>
<p>All magical powers available to your tribe and your characters are merely temporary contracts with the natives of the Blended Realm. For example, a fireball spell merely takes a chunk from a fire region, flings it until it hits something, then returns it to where it was. The energy spent to invoke the spell is the payment to the creatures and spirits who are bound to it.</p>
<p>The Blended Realm also connects to other planes of existence, which have their own challenges.</p>
<h1 id="your-island">2. Your Island</h1>
<p>The game group revolves around the Island. It is inevitable that players need to join or leave the group for various reasons, especially schedule and life maintenance. But the Island is always the center, and any new players must still become a part of it somehow.</p>
<h2 id="creation-of-the-island">Creation of the Island</h2>
<h3 id="island-statistics">Island Statistics</h3>
<p>For each of the following, roll 10 dice and multiply by 10. This is a total of 10 times that you roll the dice. This will result in excesses or deficits that you must deal with the consequences of.</p>
<p>Inhabitants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Animals - divide in half, round down</li>
<li>People - divide in half, round down</li>
</ul>
<p>Systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automation</li>
<li>Food System</li>
<li>Fortifications</li>
<li>Island Health</li>
<li>Knowledge Permanency</li>
<li>Materials System</li>
<li>Shelter</li>
<li>Water System</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="island-government">Island Government</h3>
<p>The best island governments have traits such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inclusion of the Island’s voice as being equal to or greater than the voices of those who live on it.</li>
<li>Understanding all life forms on the Island as being part of a holistic ecosystem, so that no species is ever allowed to control any other, nor be considered more deserving of resources than any other.</li>
<li>Caring for those who are unable to work, ensuring they have water, food, shelter, and communication.</li>
<li>Positive recognition and celebration of special mental traits.</li>
<li>Positive recognition and celebration of gender transition, for anyone who discovers that they need such transformation to become their true selves.</li>
<li>Recallable politicians, who will surely be recalled or even punished if they do something other than what they say. Better yet would be a system of recallable delegates who are sent to councils for the purpose of sharing information and connecting people together, and have no power to compel anyone else to do anything.</li>
</ul>
<p>Island governments that do not have such traits are likely to be making evil deals with the Empire, or may even be occupied by the Empire, with the life-draining power of the Imperial Adtextus planted on it.</p>
<p>Whatever form the government begins in, the Player-Characters definitely do not start out in charge of it.</p>
<h1 id="player-characters">3. Player Characters</h1>
<h2 id="traits">Traits</h2>
<p>Choose zero, one, two, three, or four traits. Of course, choosing four is the most powerful in game terms.</p>
<p>You can also save trait choices for later. In fact, if this is your first time creating a character, then you should reserve all four trait choices for later.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Abiotic</strong> - You do not need water, food, or sleep. You only need maintenance and recharging, both of which can be done while you are awake.</li>
<li><strong>Acid Blood</strong> - Whenever you take more than 1 damage, you cause 1/4th of the damage to all enemies within 5 feet, for a minimum of 1 damage dealt. You can also use your blood to melt through solid objects given enough time and enough blood to spare.</li>
<li><strong>Amorphous</strong> - Your natural form is a something like gelatin, ooze, slime, or good-quality refrigerated broth. You can use this form to slide down slopes, down drains, into pipes, etc. However, this causes all of your combat gear to fall off, and you also cannot perform combat actions in that form.</li>
<li><strong>Antigrav</strong> - You always have Hover I. This improves to Hover II at Power Level 20, Hover III at Power Level 40, and Hover IV at Power Level 60.</li>
<li><strong>Aquatic</strong> - You always have Swimming I. This improves to Swimming II at Power Level 20, Swimming III at Power Level 40, and Swimming IV at Power Level 60. You can also hold your breath for long periods of time underwater.</li>
<li><strong>Bouncy Body</strong> - Your Grapple actions move enemies by 10 feet rather than 5 feet.</li>
<li><strong>Claws / Fangs / Horns / Spikes</strong> - You always have Ironfist I. This improves to Ironfist II at Power Level 20, Ironfist III at Power Level 40, and Ironfist IV at Power Level 60.</li>
<li><strong>Cold Blooded</strong> - Health loss during the status phase is halved.</li>
<li><strong>Constrictor</strong> - Your accuracy for grapples is increased by an amount equal to half your Power Level.</li>
<li><strong>Echolocation</strong> - Status conditions that decrease accuracy, do not alter your accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>Elemental Breath: Specific Element</strong> - You must choose one element for this physical feature. That element is locked-in for life. You can spend 2 action points to do the Elemental Breath technique without an energy cost.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Being</strong> - Your Charge actions restore double Energy to yourself. Half of all Health damage is additionally dealt to your Energy.</li>
<li><strong>External Digestion</strong> - Your Grapple actions do double damage.</li>
<li><strong>Fur / Scales / Thick Hide</strong> - You have a natural body covering that insulates you from some types of environmental conditions. You gain two extra chances for Dramatic Chances that involve spending long periods of time in hot or cold environments.</li>
<li><strong>Gills</strong> - You are able to breathe while submerged.</li>
<li><strong>Heavy Body</strong> - Grapple actions against you do not move you.</li>
<li><strong>Hermaphrodite</strong> - You can morph your sexual characteristics by concentrating on them for several minutes in a safe area.</li>
<li><strong>Imperial Body Shape</strong> - If you wrap yourself in heavy clothing, then you look like an Imperial from a distance, thus avoiding immediate attack if you are travelling by yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Long Lived</strong> - You are able to stay young for thousands of years. You gain 5 extra skill points every Power Level, as well as at character creation, for skills in the Artistic, Physicality, Science and Tradeskills groups. You must still follow the limit of skill ratings being capped by your Power Level.</li>
<li><strong>Multi Armed</strong> - You are able to use a two-handed weapon and one shield, at the same time.</li>
<li><strong>Multi Colored</strong> - You gain 2 extra skill points every Power Level, as well as at character creation, which can be spent on skills in the Magical Elements group. You must still follow the limit of skill ratings being capped by your Power Level.</li>
<li><strong>Necropower</strong> - When you do a killing attack or technique, you get one free Charge action.</li>
<li><strong>Phasing</strong> - You always have Teleport I. This improves to Teleport II at Power Level 20, Teleport III at Power Level 40, and Teleport IV at Power Level 60.</li>
<li><strong>Power-Jumping</strong> - You always have Jump I. This improves to Jump II at Power Level 20, Jump III at Power Level 40, and Jump IV at Power Level 60.</li>
<li><strong>Quadruped</strong> - You always have Swiftfoot I. This improves to Swiftfoot II at Power Level 20, Swiftfoot III at Power Level 40, and Swiftfoot IV at Power Level 60.</li>
<li><strong>Regeneration</strong> - You heal 1 Health in each Status Phase. You always fully-heal outside of combat.</li>
<li><strong>Reincarnation</strong> - You remember past lives. You gain 5 extra skill points every Power Level, as well as at character creation, for skills in the Artistic, Physicality, Science and Tradeskills groups. You must still follow the limit of skill ratings being capped by your Power Level.</li>
<li><strong>Shifter</strong> - You can spend 4 AP to shift into the Blended Realm. Getting back is rather difficult, especially without others from your Island to help connect you and guide you back home. The amount of time it takes to shift back alone is most likely an entire Strategic Turn.</li>
<li><strong>Symbiote</strong> - You have another organism inside of you, who can keep you alive and revive you. This process takes a whole day, and can be interrupted by additional damage to your body, e.g. enemy soldiers stabbing corpses to make sure they stay down.</li>
<li><strong>Undead</strong> - Any effect that would drain your Health and give it to someone else is reversed, so that instead, you drain that other person’s Health. Any effect done by someone other than you that would normally restore your Health instead causes damage to you, ignoring Armor. Thus you rely on yourself to keep your Health up. When you die, you pop back up after 4 status phases at 1 Health. You can freely give up undeath at any time to enter regular death.
<ul>
<li>Enemy Undead who have been defeated, and are within the range of a Sanctuary Aura, will be able to freely choose normal death at that moment. Alternately, someone can spend 4 APs to remove their control bolts and allow them to continue in undeath but with free will.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Venomous Claws / Fangs / Stinger</strong> - Your unarmed attacks which do more than 1 damage also cause one stack of the Venom status condition.</li>
<li><strong>Venomous Skin / Spines</strong> - Anyone who does an unarmed attack to you, or attempts to grapple you, immediately receives one stack of the Venom status condition.</li>
<li><strong>Venomous Spit / Eye Blood</strong> - You can do a ranged attack that does exactly 2 points of damage, ignoring Physical Armor, which adds one stack of the Venom status condition to the target.</li>
<li><strong>Weaponmaster</strong> - You gain 2 extra skill points every Power Level, as well as at character creation, which can be spent on skills in the Weapon Training group. You must still follow the limit of skill ratings being capped by your Power Level.</li>
<li><strong>Wings</strong> - You always have Winged I. This improves to Winged II at Power Level 20, Winged III at Power Level 40, and Winged IV at Power Level 60.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="defining-yourself-in-terms-of-your-island">Defining Yourself In Terms Of Your Island</h2>
<p>Answer at least one of the following questions, or as many more as you like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What kinds of conversations have you had with your Island?</li>
<li>What is a special place you share on the Island with someone else?</li>
<li>What is one example of you taking something from the Island, then giving back something else?</li>
<li>Who is your family on the Island?</li>
<li>Who are you specially-bonded with on the Island?</li>
<li>If you were not born with the Island, how did you come to it?</li>
<li>If you were born on the Island, what did the Island do to note the occasion?</li>
<li>What is the representation of your connection to the Island when you travel to the Blended Realm?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-empire-fails-to-define-you">The Empire Fails To Define You</h2>
<p>Choose one or more of the following ways in which the Imperial Adtextus rejects your existence. And make no mistake - anyone who tries to assimilate into the Empire will be “rewarded” by their soul being drained to transfer the energy to an unsustainable system. The best that one can aspire to is to have their soul drained the most slowly, as even Emperors succumb to dementia more quickly than your own people do.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disabled</strong> - Your tools and work methods are not allowed by the Imperial Adtextus. Consequently, it claims that it is actually you who are unable to do anything useful. This is despite the fact that you get more stuff done than the average Imperial.</li>
<li><strong>Disloyal</strong> - You have worked more than one job in your life, or have tried more than one way of doing things. You think about different ways to solve a problem. The Adtextus defines such a life as a “disloyal” one.</li>
<li><strong>Misgendered</strong> - The Imperial Adtextus’ strict binary system cannot possibly encompass you. Or, perhaps you have committed the anti-Imperial crime of not wanting to get pregnant at age 12.</li>
<li><strong>Nonlinear</strong> - You do not speak in the manner of Imperial philosophers or senators. You could actually be more logical, systematic, and thorough than any of them, but because the Adtextus does not say to talk like that, they call you “Nonlinear”.</li>
<li><strong>Primitive</strong> - Your food, water, and shelter systems do not look like the approved patterns of the Adtextus.</li>
<li><strong>Savage</strong> - Imperials cannot comprehend your practices or traditions, nor does the Adtextus explain them, so they call you “Savage”.</li>
<li><strong>Weak</strong> - You do not think that you should attack first and talk later. Therefore, the Adtextus calls you “Weak”. You are most likely stronger than the average Legion soldier, too.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stats">Stats</h2>
<p>The Stats are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximum Health</li>
<li>Maximum Energy</li>
<li>Physical Accuracy</li>
<li>Physical Evasion</li>
<li>Physical Power</li>
<li>Physical Armor</li>
<li>Magical Accuracy</li>
<li>Magical Evasion</li>
<li>Magical Power</li>
<li>Magical Armor</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose four stats to start with a rating of 10, four stats to start with a rating of 15, and two stats to start with a rating of 20.</p>
<p>Then, increase the Maximum Health rating by 20 more.</p>
<h3 id="where-are-strength-intelligence-etc">Where are Strength, Intelligence, etc?</h3>
<p>There is intentionally no relationship between stats, and traits which may be described as being anything like “strength”, “intelligence”, etc. For example, Physical Power does not indicate muscle size, although you may choose to describe your character thusly. In fact, it is possible for any or all stats to be entirely supernatural in nature.</p>
<p>For example, an incorporeal being inhabiting a suit of armor can represent “Physical Power” as their ability to put fighting intent into their techniques, as they have no muscles or bones whatsoever.</p>
<p>Another example is a bodybuilder who chooses to start with a Physical Power of 10 rather than 20. This person may have a fear of hitting things hard, or may just lack explosiveness due to hating plyometric training.</p>
<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
<p>Choose one <strong>Skill</strong> from each of the <strong>Skill Groups</strong>. Then choose ten other skills. These twenty skills all start with a rating of 1.</p>
<p>The <strong>Skills</strong> and <strong>Skill Groups</strong> themselves are described in much more detail in <a href="#character-skills">Chapter 4: Character Skills</a>.</p>
<h2 id="personal-items">Personal Items</h2>
<p>You start with any personal items which help explain all of the above. They do not enhance stats or skills, they merely serve as possible ways in which you express those.</p>
<h2 id="combat-gear">Combat Gear</h2>
<p>You start with <strong>Item Level</strong> 1 combat gear for all of your starting skills. For example, if you chose both One-Handed Melee Weapons and One-Handed Ranged Weapons as starting skills, then you will start with one of each of those types of weapons at Item Level 1.</p>
<h2 id="power-levels">Power Levels</h2>
<p>Characters start at <strong>Power Level</strong> 1.</p>
<p>Whenever <strong>Power Level</strong> is increased (usually at the end of each gameplay session), characters improve as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>All stats have their rating increased by 1.</li>
<li>Then, the rating for Maximum Health is increased by 1 more.</li>
<li>Choose five stats to have their rating increased by 1 more. If Maximum Health is chosen, then it is increased by 2 instead of 1.</li>
<li>Choose one skill from each of the Skill Groups. Then choose ten other skills. These twenty skills all have their rating increased by 1. If the skill started at 0, then there must be some explanation of how it was learned, trained, and practiced.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="character-skills">4. Character Skills</h1>
<p>To repeat from the <a href="#player-characters">Player Characters</a> chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>For new characters: Choose one skill from each of the Skill Groups. Then choose ten other skills. These twenty skills all start with a rating of 1.</li>
<li>Upon increasing <strong>Power Level</strong>: Choose one skill from each of the Skill Groups. Then choose ten other skills. These twenty skills all have their rating increased by 1. If the skill started at 0, then there must be some explanation of how it was learned, trained, and practiced.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="skill-categories-and-skill-descriptions">Skill Categories and Skill Descriptions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Armor Training Group</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unarmored</strong> - Always have some basic protection, even while naked. However, you cannot gain the benefit of any magic that enhances armor or shields.</li>
<li><strong>Shields</strong> - Use one hand to focus on protecting yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Light Armor</strong></li>
<li><strong>Heavy Armor</strong></li>
<li><strong>Magic Armor</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Weapon Training Group</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Barehanded</strong> - You always have some basic attack power, but you also gain no benefits from anything that affects weapons, nor can you use weapon-based techniques. You end up relying on other kinds of techniques to get things done.</li>
<li><strong>One-Handed Melee Weapons</strong></li>
<li><strong>Two-Handed Melee Weapons</strong></li>
<li><strong>One-Handed Reach Weapons</strong></li>
<li><strong>Two-Handed Reach Weapons</strong></li>
<li><strong>One-Handed Ranged Weapons</strong></li>
<li><strong>Two-Handed Ranged Weapons</strong></li>
<li><strong>One-Handed Magical Weapons</strong></li>
<li><strong>Two-Handed Magical Weapons</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Magical Elements Group</strong> - Used in combination with skills of the Magical Techniques Group. Dark and Light have no relation to good and evil - except in the Imperial Adtextus. Some of the most trustworthy, honest, and generous people are specialists of the Dark. Some of the worst people are specialists of the Light. Creatures of opposite elements do not necessarily hate each other. In fact they sometimes form symbiotic relationships.
<ul>
<li><strong>Air</strong> - opposite of Earth</li>
<li><strong>Crystal</strong> - not opposite to any other element</li>
<li><strong>Dark</strong> - opposite of Light</li>
<li><strong>Earth</strong> - opposite of Air</li>
<li><strong>Fire</strong> - opposite of Water</li>
<li><strong>Light</strong> - opposite of Dark</li>
<li><strong>Moon</strong> - opposite of Wood</li>
<li><strong>Water</strong> - opposite of Fire</li>
<li><strong>Wood</strong> - opposite of Moon</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Magical Techniques Group</strong> - Used in combination with skills of the Magical Elements Groups. All magical techniques must be used in association with one specific element. Available techniques are determined by the lowest of the element and technique skill. For example, one of the techniques from Elemental Techs rating 5 is Elemental Spark. Elemental Spark can only be used with elements if your skill in those elements is also at rating 5.
<ul>
<li><strong>Alchemy Techs</strong> - Preparation and expert usage of items. However, you can only have a certain number of items prepared at a time, and when they all get used up, you must spend a <strong>Strategic Turn</strong> to prepare more.</li>
<li><strong>Cooking Techs</strong> - Keeping people well-fed and giving them constant bonuses as a result of their diet. However, this set of techniques is not as interesting as the other technique skills during combat, instead being more of a source of passive bonuses.</li>
<li><strong>Elemental Techs</strong> - Pure elemental power from the Blended Realm. These techniques can be energy and time intensive, but they also build up to great power.</li>
<li><strong>Hexenkraft Techs</strong> - Magic pulled directly into people’s bodies, weapons, and armor. This is most often associated with immediate healing, but also has deeper intricacies and complexities.</li>
<li><strong>Martial Techs</strong> - Channeling magic through one’s own body to create powerful fighting techniques. If you are both unarmed and unarmored, you will likely rely on Martial Techs heavily in combat.</li>
<li><strong>Musical Techs</strong> - Reserves action points in order to create constant effects around yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Summoning Techs</strong> - Temporary contracts with creatures from the Blended Realm.</li>
<li><strong>Weapon Melee Techs</strong> - Forming magical power within one’s weapon.</li>
<li><strong>Weapon Ranged Techs</strong> - Focusing magical power into projectiles.</li>

<li><strong>Linear Tactics Group</strong> - This group is based on forming straight battle lines. With these tactics, it is recommended to use least two lines: a front line for soaking damage and picking apart anyone who comes too close, and a rear line for damage output and support. This skill group is not contradictory with the <strong>Zone Tactics Group</strong>, and can in fact go well together, especially at higher skill ratings.
<ul>
<li><strong>Rampart Aura</strong> - Blocking enemies from moving past you. Important for anyone who must hold the edge of a battle line.</li>
<li><strong>Shield Wall</strong></li>
<li><strong>Siegebreaker</strong></li>
<li><strong>Spear Wall</strong></li>
<li><strong>Volley Fire</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Zone Tactics Group</strong> - This group is based on forming separate circular battle groups who quickly move together and seek out weak enemy groups to break through. This skill group is not contradictory with the <strong>Linear Tactics Group</strong>, and can in fact go well together, especially at higher skill ratings.
<ul>
<li><strong>Animal Speaker Aura</strong> - Communicate defensive maneuvers to allied animals, and stifle Imperial mind control on enemy animals.</li>
<li><strong>Barrier Aura</strong> - Project a constant barrier to block physical attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Regeneration Aura</strong> - Constantly regenerate health.</li>
<li><strong>Sanctuary Aura</strong> - Prevent the usage and targeting of Imperial Undeath Techniques.</li>

<h1 id="dramatic-scenes">5. Dramatic Scenes</h1>
<h2 id="dramatic-chances">Dramatic Chances</h2>
<p>There are two options - the slow but steady way, or the risky way. The slow and steady way is always guaranteed to accomplish anything that is not time-sensitive. The risky way can gain an advantage in a later situation, but of course can also result in disadvantages, injuries, or even death. Some situations do not have the slow but steady way as an option, e.g. running away from someone chasing you.</p>
<p>To do the risky way, the Game Master calls for a coin toss. The character pursuing the risky way must call heads or tails, then flip a coin. If the character guesses correctly, the risk pays-off and the advantage is secured. Otherwise, on a wrong guess, a disadvantage happens instead.</p>
<p>Some character skills, and other character-specific information, may provide extra chances in specific situations. The players should also cooperate to ensure that a variety of angles of attack are used to gain extra chances.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jane wants to sneak into a mansion.</li>
<li>John points out that Jane’s skillset includes a lot of Wood-based magic. Therefore she should try making the mansion itself open up to her.</li>
<li>Jane checks to see if the mansion is actually made of wood, by knocking on it, examining it with her Wood Magic, and other such actions.</li>
<li>The Game Master confirms that they had previously written the mansion as made of wood, including the exterior, the frame, the floor, and the doorways. Therefore the strategy of making the mansion itself open up to her should give her extra chances when infiltrating the risky way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>John tries to light a lantern in a pitch-black environment.</li>
<li>The Game Master had written that the environment was pitch-black due to Dark Magic. Therefore the Game Master says that lighting a lantern does not work.</li>
<li>Jane points out that John has an artifact of Light Magic.</li>
<li>The Game Master confirms that the artifact would indeed help to push back the Dark Magic, and therefore, John could break the artifact open to gain extra chances doing things the risky way.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="skills-giving-extra-chances">Skills Giving Extra Chances</h3>
<p>Every 10th rating achieved in a skill provides one additional Dramatic Chance when using that skill.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jack wants to unlock a door as quickly as possible. Jack also has a Locks skill rating of 25. Therefore, Jack gets two extra chances to unlock the door.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="increased-difficulty">Increased Difficulty</h3>
<p>Increased Difficulty is represented by requiring different types of Dramatic Chances. I.E. difficult dramatic situations must be attacked through multiple angles. This ensures that Dramatic Chances never come down to just having as many chances as possible for exactly one type of situation - but rather, that characters are rewarded for covering a variety of situations.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Game Master writes a situation in which the player-characters are trying to sneak into a secure mansion, in order to rob the contents of a masterwork safe.</li>
<li>Jane must succeed in sneaking into the mansion. Perhaps the Movement skill, under the Adventuring Group, can help here.</li>
<li>John must succeed in finding and disabling the darkness traps. Perhaps the Traps skill, under the Adventuring Group, can help here.</li>
<li>Jack must succeed in unlocking the safe. Perhaps the Locks skill, under the Adventuring Group, can help here.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="island-rules">6. Island Rules</h1>
<h2 id="island-stats">Island Stats</h2>
<h3 id="inhabitants">Inhabitants</h3>
<p><strong>Animals</strong> - They are unable to communicate with their Island in a way that comes across as complete thoughts to other People, and they cannot use tools, but they are nevertheless valued. They are usually used for wool, milk, contributing to the island ecosystem, and other such purposes.</p>
<p><strong>People</strong> - Defined as everyone who is capable of communicating with their Island, as well as using tools. With these two things, they can then communicate directly, or use their Island as an intermediary.</p>
<p>The required development of Systems can be considered to be Animals + People for core Systems, and just People for ones that require more tool usage.</p>
<h3 id="systems">Systems</h3>
<p><strong>Automation</strong> - Required by People to enable more of them to be available for strategic actions.</p>
<p><strong>Island Health</strong> - Required by all Inhabitants. Without it, Animals and People get sick and die.</p>
<p><strong>Food System</strong> - Required by all Inhabitants. 1 out of every 5 Animals also provides 1 Food point, representing milk, honey, fertilizer, and other things. In desperation, People might cause damage to the Island Health to feed their hunger, at a ratio of 1 Island Health damage to provide food for 5 People for one Strategic Turn. They can also slaughter 1 point of Animals for a quick 1 point of food for that turn only.</p>
<p><strong>Fortifications</strong> - Required by all Inhabitants to participate in effective defense against the Empire.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Permanency</strong> - Required by People, or else they will lose their ability to maintain everything else.</p>
<p><strong>Materials System</strong> - Required by People, representing clothes, hand tools, maintenance of shelter, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Shelter</strong> - Required by People, can also be provided to Animals if they do not naturally survive on the land.</p>
<p><strong>Water System</strong> - Required by all Inhabitants. In desperation, People might cause damage to the Island Health to slake their thirst, at a ratio of 1 Island Health damage to provide water for 5 People for one Strategic Turn.</p>
<h3 id="special-constructs">Special Constructs</h3>
<p>These provide unique flavor. But because they are special, they can be specifically targeted by the Empire, which would then result in the loss of key pieces of other Systems.</p>
<p>Every Island should have at least a few. The process of writing them should be considered part of the development of the culture and character of the Island.</p>
<h4 id="example-special-constructs">Example Special Constructs</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Circle of Rain Drums</strong> - +20 Water System. To commence the rainy season, a circle of people gather together and start drumming in order to welcome the storms.</li>
<li><strong>Cycle of Fire</strong> - +20 Shelter. Every 10 years, a village must spend one year living completely without heating, and learn how to endure the cold. After this year of cold, an enemy person or building is set on fire to renew the cycle.</li>
<li><strong>Legend of the Peacemaker</strong> - +20 Knowledge Permanency. The People of the Island were unified by someone who pacified and organized the tribal warlords, replacing their hatred and feuds with constructive social mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>The Dangerous Dress Time</strong> - +20 Fortifications. All People must spend some portion of their childhood guarding the edges of the Island, keeping watch for danger. During this time, they must also try out a variety of dresses, wigs, and other stylings which are normally associated with specific genders. The People undergoing this process are considered to be more powerful, due to being on-edge and forgoing the comforts of even their own genders.</li>
<li><strong>Wedding Warriors</strong> - +20 Fortifications. During every ceremony of marriage between two people, warriors from each family must fight each other (with nonlethal weapons). Challengers may also come and challenge anyone. Stabbing is not allowed unless a blood feud between two warriors is recognized.</li>

<h3 id="island-events-phase">Island Events Phase</h3>
<h3 id="imperial-actions-phase">Imperial Actions Phase</h3>
<p>Possible Imperial actions should make sense based on your Island’s starting situation, and everything you have done which the imperials were able to identify as coming from your island. If your island has sufficient Fortifications, then the effectiveness of Imperial Actions should be halved, or even cut to one-fifth. And of course, venturing forth to attack the Imperials directly will certainly reduce the number of actions they can do in a Strategic Turn.</p>
<p>Generally, the Imperials start with 1 action per Strategic Turn, then escalate from there, with no limit to the maximum number of actions once they start sending full Legions. Eventually you will have to face the Legions head-on in battle and kill their highest-ranked soldiers and generals.</p>
<p>Shifting the Island into the Blended Realm will prevent most Imperial Actions, but they will still be able to use special auxilia to follow you and attack you. It will also expose the Island to other conditions that will take quite a long time to adapt to.</p>

<h3 id="island-actions-phase">Island Actions Phase</h3>
<p>Each Player-Character can do one strategic action, of any kind.</p>
<p>There are also System Power Actions potentially obtained through the Calculation Phase.</p>
<p>One out of every 100 people also have enough free time to do one Island Development Action. The rest of the people are busy hunting, gathering, harvesting, cooking, weaving, sewing, crafting, etc.</p>
<h4 id="internal">Internal</h4>
<p>“Internal” covers all actions including and not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Journeying into a sealed part of the Island to help fight against physical manifestations of trauma</li>
<li>Receiving visitors from other Islands, and testing their strength</li>
<li>Dealing with misanthropes who try to dominate others</li>
<li>Learning something new from the Island, which requires a full internal journey or a long travel through an unknown area in order to comprehend</li>
<li>Playing with a new and unique creature who was born out of the Island</li>
<li>Processes of self-discipline and change which requires separation from the rest of the people of the Island</li>
</ul>
<p>If this action type is chosen, then all Player-Characters should stick together to do exactly one Internal action for the Strategic Turn.</p>
<h4 id="external">External</h4>
<p>“External” covers all actions including and not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gathering lost fragments of the island which may contain important memories</li>
<li>Visiting other Islands, participating in their unique culture</li>
<li>Infiltrating the Empire to prepare for future battles</li>
<li>Doing battle against the Empire</li>
<li>Doing anything the Island would not approve of</li>
<li>Seeking out lost knowledge and wisdom</li>
<li>Shifting into the Blended Realm without the rest of the island</li>
</ul>
<p>Just as with the “Internal” strategic action type, if this action type is chosen, then all Player-Characters should stick together to do exactly one External action for the Strategic Turn.</p>
<p>Particularly-long quests will naturally take multiple Strategic Turns. For example, journeying across the world to request aid from a different island, or deliver an artifact.</p>

<h1 id="combat">7. Combat</h1>
<p>Combat has no random elements except for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn Order</li>
<li>Techniques that explicitly have a random component</li>
</ul>
<p>So, once turn order is resolved, you should be able to calculate how the rest of the entire combat round could go.</p>
<h2 id="battle-escalation-and-energy">Battle Escalation and Energy</h2>
<p><strong>Battle Escalation</strong> starts at 1. Then at the beginning of each combat round, it increases by 1.</p>
<p>Every combatant’s <strong>Energy</strong> starts at 1. It can be recharged through the <strong>Charge Energy</strong> action, as well as through other specific means.</p>
<h2 id="turn-order">Turn Order</h2>
<p>Each combatant rolls three ten-sided dice and orders them in hundreds place, then tens place, then ones place. If using an electronic system to do the dice, then use 1d1000. Then, each combatant adds their Level to the result. The turn order starts with the highest result, and goes down from there.</p>
<p>In the case of a tie, the combatant with the higher <strong>Power Level</strong> goes first. If there is still a tie, then one of them calls heads-or-tails on a coin toss.</p>
<p>This is one of the few times that dice are ever used in the game.</p>
<h2 id="actions">Actions</h2>
<p>Each combatant gets four <strong>action points</strong>. The possible actions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attack</strong> - 1 AP</li>
<li><strong>Change Armor</strong> - 4 AP</li>
<li><strong>Change Weapon</strong> - 2 AP</li>
<li><strong>Charge Energy</strong> - 1 AP</li>
<li><strong>Defend</strong> - 1 AP</li>
<li><strong>Face Forward</strong> - 0 AP</li>
<li><strong>Grapple</strong> - 2 AP</li>
<li><strong>Move</strong> - 1 AP</li>
<li><strong>Perform Technique</strong> - 1 AP (some techniques have different AP costs)</li>
<li><strong>Use Item</strong> - 1 AP</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="attack">Attack</h3>
<p>First, consider <strong>Facing</strong>. The side or diagonal corner that the attacker hits is determined by drawing a line from the center of the attacker’s square to the center of the target’s square.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the attack is aimed at the target’s <strong>sides</strong>, not including the diagonal corners, then the target’s evasion is halved against the attack.</li>
<li>If the attack is aimed at the target’s <strong>back</strong>, including the two diagonal corners, then the target’s evasion is cut to 1/4th against the attack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, compare the attacker’s accuracy to the target’s evasion:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the attacker’s accuracy is less than the target’s evasion, then the target’s armor is applied a second time.</li>
<li>If the attacker’s accuracy is less than half of the target’s evasion, then the attack or technique misses.</li>
<li>If the attacker’s accuracy is double or higher than the target’s evasion, then the target’s armor is not applied, and the target is knocked back by 5 feet.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="change-armor">Change Armor</h3>
<p>Changes which type of armor you are using.</p>
<p>You can also roleplay that your armor or body transforms, but this must still take 4 APs.</p>
<h3 id="change-weapon">Change Weapon</h3>
<p>Changes what you have in your hands.</p>
<p>You can also roleplay that your weapon can be used in different ways or has different forms, but this must still take 2 APs.</p>
<h3 id="charge-energy">Charge Energy</h3>
<p>The Charge Energy action restores Energy to yourself, equal to the Battle Escalation number.</p>
<h3 id="defend">Defend</h3>
<p>The Defend action keeps your Physical Evasion, Magical Evasion and Magical Armor up. Without at least one Defend action, these stats fall down to equalling your Power Level instead.</p>
<p>Additional Defend actions in one round will each add an amount to your Physical Evasion, Physical Armor, Magical Evasion, and Magical Armor equal to half of their respective base ratings, until your next turn.</p>
<h3 id="face-forward">Face Forward</h3>
<p>This action makes you face one of the four directions. It costs 0 AP, but you cannot do it outside of your turn, so choose carefully.</p>
<p>In theory, some combatants may twirl around a million times before ending their turn, although there is no practical purpose to doing so.</p>
<h3 id="grapple">Grapple</h3>
<p>Similar to Attack, except the range is always 5 feet, the amount of damage is always equal to 1/10th of the target’s Maximum Health, and a successful action results in the target being moved 5 feet back. The damage ignores Physical Armor.</p>
<p>Consequently, even the most well-armored soldiers must beware grapplers.</p>
<h3 id="move">Move</h3>
<p>The standard movement type is Foot, providing 20 feet of horizontal movement per Move Action. Maximum upwards jump is 2 feet. Maximum horizontal jump is 5 feet. Maximum downwards jump is 4 feet. There are other movement types, traits, statuses, etc. that can change this.</p>
<p>Horizontal jumps count against your horizontal movement. For example, jumping across a 5-foot gap counts as using 5 feet of horizontal movement.</p>
<p>Vertical jumps do not count against horizontal movement. For example, moving into a 5-foot-square that is 5 feet lower in elevation is only considered to be 5 feet of horizontal movement.</p>
<h3 id="perform-technique">Perform Technique</h3>
<p>Most techniques only take 1 AP, and have other costs or limitations to compensate. Some techniques, however, explicitly state that they take 2 or more AP, or otherwise reserve AP.</p>
<p>Reactions reserve AP, but can only be triggered once until your next turn. However, you can reserve multiple of the same reaction.</p>
<h3 id="use-item">Use Item</h3>
<p>Item usage generally has a range of five feet, i.e. targeting someone in a side-adjacent square.</p>
<h2 id="movement-types">Movement Types</h2>

<li><strong>Swiftfoot III</strong> - 35 feet of horizontal movement per Move Action.</li>
<li><strong>Swiftfoot IV</strong> - 40 feet of horizontal movement per Move Action.</li>

<li><strong>Swimming I</strong> - Maximum of 10 feet of horizontal movement through water. Cannot be used at the same time as Waterwalking or Hover.
<ul>
<li><strong>Swimming II</strong> - Maximum of 15 feet of horizontal movement through water. Cannot be used at the same time as Waterwalking or Hover.</li>
<li><strong>Swimming III</strong> - Maximum of 20 feet of horizontal movement through water. Cannot be used at the same time as Waterwalking or Hover.</li>
<li><strong>Swimming IV</strong> - No limit to horizontal movement through water. Cannot be used at the same time as Waterwalking or Hover.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Waterwalking</strong> - Move and stand on top of water as if it were normal. Cannot be used at the same time as Swimming.</li>
<li><strong>Winged I</strong> - Falling damage is halved. Requires 2 Move Actions to move with this type, in which case you get 40 feet of horizontal movement, maximum upwards jump of 6 feet, maximum horizontal jump of 15 feet, and maximum downwards jump of 8 feet.
<ul>
<li><strong>Winged II</strong> - Falling damage is halved. Requires 2 Move Actions to move with this type, in which case you get 50 feet of horizontal movement, maximum upwards jump of 10 feet, maximum horizontal jump of 20 feet, and maximum downwards jump of 12 feet.</li>
<li><strong>Winged III</strong> - Falling damage is halved. Requires 2 Move Actions to move with this type, in which case you get 60 feet of horizontal movement, maximum upwards jump of 14 feet, maximum horizontal jump of 25 feet, and maximum downwards jump of 16 feet.</li>

<li><strong>Teleport IV</strong> - Falling damage is halved. You can move to any position you see within 30 feet. Cannot be used at the same time as any other movement type.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="special-circumstances">Special Circumstances</h2>
<p>Falling damage is equal to 2 points for each foot beyond your maximum downwards jump distance. Falling off the edge of a flying Island is quite a lot of damage. Note that various movement types also state that they halve falling damage. With multiple such movement types, each one further halves the remaining falling damage, so it can be cut to 1/4th, 1/8th, 1/16th, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A combatant is pushed by 5 feet, and ends up falling 20 feet. Their maximum downwards jump is 4 feet. So they take 16 * 2, or 32, points of falling damage. This is lethal to Power Level 1 combatants without some way to halve it, and still hurts quite a lot to more powerful combatants.</p>
<h2 id="status-conditions">Status Conditions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Air Tornado Upper</strong> - When you cause more than 1 damage with an Unarmed attack or technique, and your Magical Accuracy is greater than 1.5x the target’s Magical Evasion, you cause the target to spin around and change facing to a direction of your choice.</li>

<li><strong>Babbling</strong> - Unable to do actions that require speaking, or spending Energy. Removed whenever you take Dark elemental damage.</li>

<li><strong>Crystal Diffusion Fists</strong> - When you cause at least 4 damage with an Unarmed attack or technique, and your Magical Accuracy is greater than 1.5x the target’s Magical Evasion, 1/4th of your damage is additionally dealt to the target’s Energy.</li>
<li><strong>Crystalbarrier</strong> - All melee and reach attacks aimed at you will cause the attacker to get the Bleeding status. Add your Power Level to your Physical Armor.</li>
<li><strong>Dark Force Ark</strong> - When you cause more than 1 damage with an Unarmed attack or technique, you and all square-side-adjacent allies regain 1 Energy.</li>

<li><strong>Elemental Armor Resin: <Specific></strong> - Requires that you use armor and/or a shield. Incoming damage from the specified element is nullified. If this occurs, then one stack of this status is also removed during the status phase. The most recent application of this status removes all previous applications.</li>
<li><strong>Elemental Charge Feedback: <Specific></strong> - All element charges of the specified element instead cause you to lose health, then the charges disappear. The amount is 10% of your Maximum Health for each charge. This includes all charges you have when the status is first caused, and all charges you gain while having this status. The most recent application of this status removes all previous applications.</li>
<li><strong>Elemental Resistance: <Specific></strong> - Incoming damage from the specified element is halved, after taking armor into account. For example, if you have the Elemental Resistance: Fire status, you take 30 physical Fire damage, and you have 20 Physical Armor, then you take 5 damage to your Health. The most recent application of this status removes all previous applications. Note that Elemental Armor Coating applies before subtracting armor from the damage, while Elemental Resistance applies after, so having both statuses at the same time is a good combination if the enemy is only capable of one type of elemental damage.</li>
<li><strong>Elemental Sticky Bomb: <Specific></strong> - You take 1 elemental damage of the specific element, per status phase. Multiple sticky bombs can stack. Thankfully they have finite durations.</li>
<li><strong>Elemental Weakness: <Specific></strong> - Incoming damage from the specified element bypasses your armor. The most recent application of this status removes all previous applications.</li>

If the damage boost occurs, then one stack of this status is removed during the status phase. The most recent application of this status removes all previous applications. If you have both Elemental Weapon Coating and Elemental Weapon Resin statuses, then the Resin effect supercedes the Coating effect until the Resin wears off, after which the Coating will take over.</li>
<li><strong>Entombed</strong> - Unable to move. Physical Evasion is zero. Removed whenever you take Air elemental damage.</li>
<li><strong>Fire Wheel Sprinting</strong> - Your horizontal movement is increased by 10 feet. Every enemy who you move past in square-side contact receives an amount of Fire damage equal to 1/10th of your Magical Power, ignoring Magical Armor and Magical Evasion.</li>
<li><strong>Fireaura</strong> - You cause fire damage to all adjacent enemies during the status phase, as if it had been done by the Burning status. Add your Power Level to your Magical Armor.</li>

<li><strong>Recharging</strong> - Regain an amount of Energy equal to 10% of your Maximum Energy per status phase.</li>
<li><strong>Regenerating</strong> - Regain an amount of Health equal to 10% of your Maximum Health per status phase.</li>
<li><strong>Repulsed Weapon</strong> - You cannot use your weapon. This status condition is always removed during the status phase.</li>
<li><strong>Resuscitate</strong> - Remove one stack of Resuscitate during the status phase. When the final stack of the Resuscitate status is removed, you are revived with 1 Health.</li>
<li><strong>Shadowconcealed</strong> - Add your Level to your Physical Evasion and Magical Evasion.</li>
<li><strong>Shattered</strong> - All Armor is halved. Multiple stacks of Shattered do not cause additional effects. One stack of Shattered is removed during the status phase.</li>

<li><strong>Shocked</strong> - Magical Power and Magical Armor are halved. Removed whenever you take Earth elemental damage. Can be removed by spending all action points to breathe and calm down from the shock.</li>
<li><strong>Stonehide</strong> - Add your Power Level to your Physical Armor. For all melee and reach attacks against you, if your Magical Accuracy is higher than the attacker’s Magical Evasion, then the attacker gets the Repulsed Weapon status condition.</li>

<li><strong>Water Flow Returning Force</strong> - Every time you take more than 1 damage from an enemy who is square-side-adjacent, and your Magical Evasion is greater than 1.5x that enemy’s Magical Accuracy, you immediately do an Unarmed attack against that enemy. This does not use APs and occurs immediately after you took the damage, thus possibly preventing the enemy from using the rest of their APs depending on circumstances.</li>
<li><strong>Wood Tree Of Life</strong> - Every time you regain Health, 1/4th of that regain is additionally done to all square-side-adjacent allies.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="temporary-allies">Temporary Allies</h2>
<p>All possible allies described here are explicitly “temporary”. They will inevitably find excuses to cease helping you for some reason or another.</p>
<h3 id="unpaid-legions">Unpaid Legions</h3>
<p>They object to the fact that the Patrician class controls them, but they think everything else about the Empire and Adtextus are fine. They merely want to ensure that the Senate is abolished and the Emperor is always a representative of the Legions. Getting an Unpaid Legion to realize that anything else is wrong is very difficult, since they are still able to use their Imperial equipment, training, and the life-draining power of the Adtextus to feel good about dominating others. They may openly state that they are allied with you in order to gain trust with other Islands, or to gain access to your food and water, but they will always criticize people who do not fit their version of the Adtextus.</p>
<h3 id="exoticist-senators">Exoticist Senators</h3>
<p>These Senators think the Adtextus is too destructive to other cultures, but they see nothing wrong with the Empire continuing to take over everything. They merely want to change the Adtextus, or put Islands into Density Camps to be gawked at.</p>
<p>They will give you Imperial food and money to entertain them, or even small pieces of land on their continent, but nothing else. They especially will not play their power games to advance your interests, as that would be “uncivil”, despite the fact that they already play their power games all the time to enrich themselves in other ways. If you tell them that perhaps they should think of you as thinking living beings, then they will get angry and call you “ungrateful”.</p>
<h3 id="other-superpowers">Other Superpowers</h3>
<p>The other superpowers are nowhere near your Island, and aspire to take over the world themselves. What they lack in the life-draining Adtextus and the brutality of the Legions, they make up for in their own ways. For example, one superpower might still have a strictly hierarchical ideology magic that causes harm, but it may use a lot more human blood sacrifice and cause a lot less damage to the land. Another superpower might allow Islands to retain their culture, but the Islands are obligated to give their most strong and beautiful people to suffer indignities until they die of pain and despair.</p>
<h2 id="the-imperial-adtextus">The Imperial Adtextus</h2>
<p>The Imperial Adtextus has been engineered over time to maintain a strict and inflexible hierarchical structure. Its driving principles are inherently wrong. All attempts to add new words to it will only result in the new words being corrupted by those principles. Even before the Adtextus was codified, the Empire was still relying heavily on life-draining magic. But now it has grown into its own beast, which not even Emperors can control.</p>
<p>It is the foundation for the magic that the Empire uses to enforce its own existence. It grants Imperials the ability to drain energy from others, and absorbs elemental power to strengthen buildings, weapons, and armor. There is nothing mysterious or secret about it. All Imperial scholars know exactly when it was founded, how, and by whom. In fact, it metes out the Imperial sense of time itself, down to the smallest fractions of a second. The first scholars who wrote it down are revered as great philosophers, although still mortal.</p>
<p>It is spread through the following means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monuments to the Empire, with portions of the Adtextus written upon them. These monuments are activated with religious rituals.</li>
<li>Orators constantly reciting the Adtextus in public. Their own life force is burned in order to perform energy transfers on all who can hear them.</li>
<li>Slaves having their hearts ripped out in religious rituals. Their life force is transferred to the shared energy field of the Adtextus.</li>
<li>Patricians organizing their estates in accordance with the Adtextus. The Adtextus then shoots magical effects at the estates to accelerate the energy transfers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of the Adtextus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Correct Order - Something must always be on top, taking from everything under it. Any surplus must be used to reinforce and expand this hierarchy. This is the foundational principle of the Adtextus, which all other Imperial magic relies on. If this principle were altered or removed, then all current Imperial magic would cease to function.</li>
<li>Center of the Universe - The Imperial Palace, which the Emperor is required to administrate from. Before the Adtextus was established, it was called the “Middle House”.</li>
<li>Bio Cutting Resource - Person in the military. It is expected that all people gendered male who are ages 15 to 35 will serve in the military. Those who do not are considered weak, and relegated to the lowest work possible. Those who prove themselves may have a chance to become a proper Legionary, and thereby gain land and slaves at the end of their service. In fact much Imperial conquest is solely for the purpose of delivering these promises to their Legions. The Adtextus itself is used to repress the minds of those who are unpaid, and consequently would consider desertion or even rebellion, although the schemes of the Patricians may exploit such disgruntled Legions.</li>
<li>Dirt Cutting Resource - Person who works outside the house and is not in the military. All people gendered male who are age 36 or older are expected to work until death. Those who were not fortunate enough to be a Legionary and/or get paid must wander around, constantly begging for work or even food. The Adtextus itself tries to twist their minds towards volunteering for slavery, making them believe that at least then they would have consistent food and drink.</li>
<li>Bio Assembly Resource - A person gendered woman who conforms to precise standards of appearance, and who has been proven to have birthed children. Women are legally owned by their fathers until they are sold to their husbands. Violence against women is only considered harmful so far as it affects the man’s property. A few women have played the power games at the Patrician level, although the Adtextus ensures they are perceived as evil witches and rewrites all imperial records of their deeds.</li>
<li>Bio Consumption Resources - A narrowly-defined set of plants, animals, and drinks that are considered high-class imperial food. All other food is defined as unclean and disgusting. Of course, the plants and animals only thrive within specific regions, and do poorly in others, causing the Empire to consider those other regions barren wastes. Imperial agricultural practices also deplete the soil and cause it to erode within decades, so the heartlands of the Empire are already barren by their definition. The heartlands only produce grain and wine today because of life energy drained from slaves - and it takes the lives of more and more slaves each year to maintain the current mode of production.</li>
<li>Unweighted Warrior - A term that was added by Emperor Decimus, in an effort to prevent the Adtextus from killing the St’los Tribe. So, instead of killing the tribe, it just mutated them into their current infamous forms. Emperor Decimus had to issue proclamations that the St’los Tribe was always that way, and that it was a mistake to take them on as military auxiliaries in the first place. Then he ordered the tribe to be decimated, for their failure to live up to expectations.</li>
<li>Deep Grass - A term that was added by Emperor Livius, in an effort to allow crops that would grow in Yurk Province without destroying the topsoil. But, due to the way the Adtextus was designed, it changed the grass itself to deplete the soil rather than replenish it, because the Adtextus does not allow anything from the Empire to give back to anything else. Emperor Livius proceeded to have many of his scholars publicly-executed for their failure, because the Adtextus only allows punishment to flow downwards.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="intentionally-unanswered-questions">Intentionally Unanswered Questions</h2>
<p>Who is the current Emperor? Is this person putting any effort whatsoever into reforming the Empire or modifying the Adtextus? But even if they did put in such effort, the Adtextus itself has a foundation that would only allow the Emperor to change the flavor or speed of various processes. Any Emperor who would destroy the Adtextus must accept that unless the Imperials themselves switch to a different way of life, they will surely die from the removal of the Adtextus.</p>
<p>Who are the St’los Tribe? What horrific fate befell them as a result of being classified as “Unweighted Warriors”? Are they anywhere near your Island?</p>
<p>What is Yurk Province? How is it doing after the failed experiment with Deep Grass? Is it anywhere near your own Island? Who were the people who used to live in it, or who currently survive in it?</p>
<p>Is there any kind of grand civilization in the Blended Realm? If so, then what would be their aims towards the solid world?</p>
<p>Is the Empire actually close to division and collapse? If so, then are the other Islands looking to conquer yours? Will they establish an Adtextus of their own to just make another evil regime with their own special characteristics? Perhaps the dreaded Savage Wolf Tribe could be the one to overthrow the Empire, and replace it with raw violence all the time?</p>

<p>Armored Dragons started out as bioweapons from an ancient age. All surviving Armored Dragons have long since shaken off their programming, and now work for anyone who demonstrates kindness towards Island creatures. They are angered by any mistreatment of animals, especially Imperial practices, and constantly regain 1 Energy per status phase while angry. They are large enough to be ridden and still fly. According to the Islands, the Armored Dragons know things that even the Islands do not, but they can only interface with ancient technology that predates the devastation of the continents, so they take their secrets to their graves.</p>

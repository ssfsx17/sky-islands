# 1\. Introduction

The Empire hungers for the life force of your flying island in the sky,
and will also enslave everyone on it, including you. Now what?

## Group Organization

The game group for **Sky Islands** is organized around a single island.
Each Island is a full character unto itself, and is capable of
communication with other life forms.

It is customary for at least one of the people to be designated the
**Game Master**, responsible for thinking of new challenges and twists,
while the others in the group are the **Players**. The focus of the game
is on a conflict with a known entity, rather than mystery, so it is
possible for the position of Game Master to be rotated without losing
grasp of the overall storyline.

For a stable group that customarily relies on a single **Game Master**
for long periods of time, it is practical for the **Game Master** to
introduce deeper mysteries and more complex plots as the campaign goes
on. Otherwise, if a group typically has difficulty having a consistent
**Game Master**, then it should stick to the war against the Empire, and
keep all the larger plot elements to their own characters. The core book
intentionally has little lore on anything other than the Empire, to
ensure that the entire rest of the world can be mysterious to everyone
involved.

A group with no **Game Master** is possible, if there is work put into
making the antagonists act and strategize autonomously. This is the
basis of some board and card games (which the writer of **Sky Islands**
enjoys very much), but less research has been spent on accomplishing
this for complex role-playing games such as **Sky Islands**.

Each **Player** is responsible for creating and playing at least one
**Player Character**. It is usually difficult for a **Player** to have
more **Player Characters** than everyone else while still giving room
for the rest of the group to engage in role-playing. It is not
impossible, but you need to know your group dynamics well before you
allow such a situation.

There is always a risk of one or more **Players** telling others how to
design and grow their **Player Characters**. An organized force can be
more effective than a mob of individuals doing their own thing, but
every single **Player** must be given space and trust to make their own
decisions, and practice a bit of creativity.

## The World

The World’s name, in the language of your Island, is something you need
to figure out. Its surface is full of turbulent oceans, jagged crags,
opaque fogs, active volcanoes, and shifting deserts. The reasons why so
much of the World is this way are deep in your Island’s memory, and it
teaches you and your people to never repeat the same mistakes that
caused this situation.

There are continents with powerful nations on them, but they sustain
themselves through predation and exploitation. They could change their
ways and restore the lush forests, swamps and jungles that they once had
on their continents, but their destructive systems are too deeply
entrenched in their politics. In short, they are perpetuating the
mistakes that resulted in the ruined state of the rest of the World.
They are exactly what your Island warned you about.

It is up to the Sky Islands to practice the growth of life, and the
expansion of life-bearing capacity. But they can only fly so quickly.
Your Island is too close to the nation you call The Empire, and that
Empire’s military forces creep forward faster than your Island can
escape.

## The Empire

The Empire uses its magical word system, the Imperial Adtextus, to
control life energy flows. It is designed to be overly simplistic, to
compress everything down into mere resources for Imperial utilization.
Any living being who is subjected to it is inevitably drained to death
so that the system can exercise its power against others.

The Adtextus can be considered a mere formalization and systemization of
many things the Empire had done prior to its codification. The Empire
itself was founded by the act of draining a Sky-Island of its life force
in order to keep imperial farming practices functioning for a few more
years, rather than actually fix their practices. The proponents of
farming technique upgrades were punished by publicly having their life
force drained in order to make the senators slightly younger.

Even the senators and emperors are still mutated into shadows of their
original selves, sometimes dying young despite draining many of their
slaves of life force. Many Sky-Islands and their inhabitants are
likewise deformed from mere proximity to the Empire. But if you regain
the word system that is sufficiently-complex to describe yourself, then
you can be restored.

The Imperial Adtextus is not able to reproduce itself. It relies on
Imperials to willingly do that, in exchange for temporary power gained
by its practice. This has fueled the Empire into becoming a frightening
military power, draining island after island in order to keep going in a
zombie state. If left alone then it will surely collapse in on itself,
but it keeps on finding new ways to reach other islands and wage war
against them.

## The Blended Realm

The Blended Realm is so-named because it looks like large swathes of
solid colors, which blend together at special edges to create chaotic
but beautiful reactions. The solid-color regions are purely of one
element, and are home to plants, sentient creatures, spirits, and other
things that are purely of that element. They can even be brought back to
the solid world with no ill effects, although they can return to their
origins in the Blended Realm whenever they wish. If someone uses dirt or
other material from the Blended Realm to construct something in the
solid world, then they could return at some random time, unless their
bound creatures and spirits agree to keep them in the solid realm for a
specific amount of time.

The Realm is easily accessible to those outside of the influence of the
Imperial Adtextus. Yet it is also quite dangerous, for it morphs and
shifts in ways that are not amenable to any way of life that was learned
in the solid world. Some sky islands have given up existence in the
solid world to land on the Blended Realm, but they are still not immune
to the Empire, they merely have gained some terrain advantages. The
Empire has specialized auxilia - slave soldiers captured from other
islands - who are able to invade the Blended Realm.

The Realm reacts to the health of the solid world. The worse the
condition of the islands in the solid world, the more the Blended Realm
retreats from it, and the more difficult it is for mortals to shift
themselves into the Realm. It is feared that if the Empire were to take
over the world, then the Blended Realm would leave forever.

All magical powers available to your tribe and your characters are
merely temporary contracts with the natives of the Blended Realm. For
example, a fireball spell merely takes a chunk from a fire region,
flings it until it hits something, then returns it to where it was. The
energy spent to invoke the spell is the payment to the creatures and
spirits who are bound to it.

The Blended Realm also connects to other planes of existence, which have
their own challenges.

# 2\. Your Island

The game group revolves around the Island. It is inevitable that players
need to join or leave the group for various reasons, especially schedule
and life maintenance. But the Island is always the center, and any new
players must still become a part of it somehow.

## Creation of the Island

### Island Statistics

For each of the following, roll 10 dice and multiply by 10. This is a
total of 10 times that you roll the dice. This will result in excesses
or deficits that you must deal with the consequences of.

Inhabitants:

  - Animals - divide in half, round down
  - People - divide in half, round down

Systems:

  - Automation
  - Food System
  - Fortifications
  - Island Health
  - Knowledge Permanency
  - Materials System
  - Shelter
  - Water System

### Island Government

The best island governments have traits such as:

  - Inclusion of the Island’s voice as being equal to or greater than
    the voices of those who live on it.
  - Understanding all life forms on the Island as being part of a
    holistic ecosystem, so that no species is ever allowed to control
    any other.
  - Caring for those who are unable to work, ensuring they have water,
    food, shelter, and companionship.
  - Positive recognition and celebration of special mental traits.
  - Positive recognition and celebration of gender transition, for
    anyone who discovers that they need such transformation to become
    their true selves.
  - Recallable politicians, who will surely be recalled or even punished
    if they do something other than what they say. Better yet would be a
    system of recallable delegates who are sent to councils for the
    purpose of sharing information and connecting people together, and
    have no power to compel anyone else to do anything.

Island governments that do not have such traits are likely to be making
evil deals with the Empire, or may even be occupied by the Empire, with
the life-draining power of the Imperial Adtextus planted on it.

Whatever form the government begins in, the Player-Characters definitely
do not start out in charge of it.

# 3\. Player Characters

## Traits

Choose zero, one, two, three, or four traits. Of course, choosing four
is the most powerful in game terms.

You can also save trait choices for later. In fact, if this is your
first time creating a character, then you should reserve all four trait
choices for later.

  - **Abiotic** - You do not need water, food, or sleep. You only need
    maintenance and recharging, both of which can be done while you are
    awake.
  - **Acid Blood** - Whenever you take more than 1 damage, you cause
    1/4th of the damage to all enemies within 5 feet, for a minimum of 1
    damage dealt. You can also use your blood to melt through solid
    objects given enough time and enough blood to spare.
  - **Amorphous** - Your natural form is a something like gelatin, ooze,
    slime, or good-quality refrigerated broth. You can use this form to
    slide down slopes, down drains, into pipes, etc. However, this
    causes all of your combat gear to fall off, and you also cannot
    perform combat actions in that form.
  - **Antigrav** - You always have Hover I. This improves to Hover II at
    Power Level 20, Hover III at Power Level 40, and Hover IV at Power
    Level 60.
  - **Aquatic** - You always have Swimming I. This improves to Swimming
    II at Power Level 20, Swimming III at Power Level 40, and Swimming
    IV at Power Level 60. You can also hold your breath for long periods
    of time underwater.
  - **Bouncy Body** - Your Grapple actions move enemies by 10 feet
    rather than 5 feet.
  - **Claws / Fangs / Horns / Spikes** - You always have Ironfist I.
    This improves to Ironfist II at Power Level 20, Ironfist III at
    Power Level 40, and Ironfist IV at Power Level 60.
  - **Cold Blooded** - Health loss during the status phase is halved.
  - **Constrictor** - Your accuracy for grapples is increased by an
    amount equal to half your Power Level.
  - **Echolocation** - Status conditions that decrease accuracy, do not
    alter your accuracy.
  - **Elemental Breath: Specific Element** - You must choose one element
    for this physical feature. That element is locked-in for life. You
    can spend 2 action points to do the Elemental Breath technique
    without an energy cost.
  - **Energy Being** - Your Charge actions restore double Energy to
    yourself.
  - **External Digestion** - Your Grapple actions do double damage.
  - **Fur / Scales / Thick Hide** - You have a natural body covering
    that insulates you from some types of environmental conditions. You
    gain two extra chances for Dramatic Chances that involve spending
    long periods of time in hot or cold environments.
  - **Gills** - You are able to breathe while submerged.
  - **Heavy Body** - Grapple actions against you do not move you.
  - **Hermaphrodite** - You can morph your sexual characteristics by
    concentrating on them for several minutes in a safe area.
  - **Imperial Body Shape** - If you wrap yourself in heavy clothing,
    then you look like an Imperial from a distance, thus avoiding
    immediate attack if you are travelling by yourself.
  - **Long Lived** - You are able to stay young for thousands of years.
    You gain 5 extra skill points every Power Level, as well as at
    character creation, for skills in the Artistic, Physicality, Science
    and Tradeskills groups. You must still follow the limit of skill
    ratings being capped by your Power Level.
  - **Multi Armed** - You are able to use a two-handed weapon and one
    shield, at the same time.
  - **Multi Colored** - You gain 2 extra skill points every Power Level,
    as well as at character creation, which can be spent on skills in
    the Magical Elements group. You must still follow the limit of skill
    ratings being capped by your Power Level.
  - **Necropower** - When you do a killing attack or technique, you get
    one free Charge action.
  - **Phasing** - You always have Teleport I. This improves to Teleport
    II at Power Level 20, Teleport III at Power Level 40, and Teleport
    IV at Power Level 60.
  - **Power-Jumping** - You always have Jump I. This improves to Jump II
    at Power Level 20, Jump III at Power Level 40, and Jump IV at Power
    Level 60.
  - **Quadruped** - You always have Swiftfoot I. This improves to
    Swiftfoot II at Power Level 20, Swiftfoot III at Power Level 40, and
    Swiftfoot IV at Power Level 60.
  - **Regeneration** - You heal 1 Health in each Status Phase. You
    always fully-heal outside of combat.
  - **Reincarnation** - You remember past lives. You gain 5 extra skill
    points every Power Level, as well as at character creation, for
    skills in the Artistic, Physicality, Science and Tradeskills groups.
    You must still follow the limit of skill ratings being capped by
    your Power Level.
  - **Shifter** - You can spend 4 AP to shift into the Blended Realm.
    Getting back is rather difficult, especially without others from
    your Island to help connect you and guide you back home. The amount
    of time it takes to shift back alone is most likely an entire
    Strategic Turn.
  - **Symbiote** - You have another organism inside of you, who can keep
    you alive and revive you. This process takes a whole day, and can be
    interrupted by additional damage to your body, e.g. enemy soldiers
    stabbing corpses to make sure they stay down.
  - **Undead** - Any effect that would drain your Health and give it to
    someone else is reversed, so that instead, you drain that other
    person’s Health. Any effect done by someone other than you that
    would normally restore your Health instead causes damage to you,
    ignoring Armor. Thus you rely on yourself to keep your Health up.
    When you die, you pop back up after 4 status phases at 1 Health.
  - **Venomous Claws / Fangs / Stinger** - Your unarmed attacks which do
    more than 1 damage also cause one stack of the Venom status
    condition.
  - **Venomous Skin / Spines** - Anyone who does an unarmed attack to
    you, or attempts to grapple you, immediately receives one stack of
    the Venom status condition.
  - **Venomous Spit / Eye Blood** - You can do a ranged attack that does
    exactly 2 points of damage, ignoring Physical Armor, which adds one
    stack of the Venom status condition to the target.
  - **Weaponmaster** - You gain 2 extra skill points every Power Level,
    as well as at character creation, which can be spent on skills in
    the Weapon Training group. You must still follow the limit of skill
    ratings being capped by your Power Level.
  - **Wings** - You always have Winged I. This improves to Winged II at
    Power Level 20, Winged III at Power Level 40, and Winged IV at Power
    Level 60.

## Defining Yourself In Terms Of Your Island

Answer at least one of the following questions, or as many more as you
like:

  - What kinds of conversations have you had with your Island?
  - What is a special place you share on the Island with someone else?
  - What is one example of you taking something from the Island, then
    giving back something else?
  - Who is your family on the Island?
  - Who are you specially-bonded with on the Island?
  - If you were not born with the Island, how did you come to it?
  - If you were born on the Island, what did the Island do to note the
    occasion?
  - What is the representation of your connection to the Island when you
    travel to the Blended Realm?

## The Empire Fails To Define You

Choose one or more of the following ways in which the Imperial Adtextus
rejects your existence. And make no mistake - anyone who tries to
assimilate into the Empire will be “rewarded” by their soul being
drained to transfer the energy to an unsustainable system. The best that
one can aspire to is to have their soul drained the most slowly, as even
Emperors succumb to dementia more quickly than your own people do.

  - **Disabled** - Your tools and work methods are not allowed by the
    Imperial Adtextus. Consequently, it claims that it is actually you
    who are unable to do anything useful. This is despite the fact that
    you get more stuff done than the average Imperial.
  - **Disloyal** - You have worked more than one job in your life, or
    have tried more than one way of doing things. You think about
    different ways to solve a problem. The Adtextus defines such a life
    as a “disloyal” one.
  - **Misgendered** - The Imperial Adtextus’ strict binary system cannot
    possibly encompass you. Or, perhaps you have committed the
    anti-Imperial crime of not wanting to get pregnant at age 12.
  - **Nonlinear** - You do not speak in the manner of Imperial
    philosophers or senators. You could actually be more logical,
    systematic, and thorough than any of them, but because the Adtextus
    does not say to talk like that, they call you “Nonlinear”.
  - **Primitive** - Your food, water, and shelter systems do not look
    like the approved patterns of the Adtextus.
  - **Savage** - Imperials cannot comprehend your practices or
    traditions, nor does the Adtextus explain them, so they call you
    “Savage”.
  - **Weak** - You do not think that you should attack first and talk
    later. Therefore, the Adtextus calls you “Weak”. You are most likely
    stronger than the average Legion soldier, too.

## Stats

The Stats are:

  - Maximum Health
  - Maximum Energy
  - Physical Accuracy
  - Physical Evasion
  - Physical Power
  - Physical Armor
  - Magical Accuracy
  - Magical Evasion
  - Magical Power
  - Magical Armor

Choose four stats to start with a rating of 10, four stats to start with
a rating of 15, and two stats to start with a rating of 20.

Then, increase the Maximum Health rating by 20 more.

### Where are Strength, Intelligence, etc?

There is intentionally no relationship between stats, and traits which
may be described as being anything like “strength”, “intelligence”, etc.
For example, Physical Power does not indicate muscle size, although you
may choose to describe your character thusly. In fact, it is possible
for any or all stats to be entirely supernatural in nature.

For example, an incorporeal being inhabiting a suit of armor can
represent “Physical Power” as their ability to put fighting intent into
their techniques, as they have no muscles or bones whatsoever.

Another example is a bodybuilder who chooses to start with a Physical
Power of 10 rather than 20. This person may have a fear of hitting
things hard, or may just lack explosiveness due to hating plyometric
training.

## Skills

Choose one **Skill** from each of the **Skill Groups**. Then choose ten
other skills. These twenty skills all start with a rating of 1.

The **Skills** and **Skill Groups** themselves are described in much
more detail in [Chapter 4: Character Skills](#character-skills).

## Combat Gear

You start with **Item Level** 1 combat gear for all of your starting
skills. For example, if you chose both One-Handed Melee Weapons and
One-Handed Ranged Weapons as starting skills, then you will start with
one of each of those types of weapons at Item Level 1.

## Power Levels

Characters start at **Power Level** 1.

Whenever **Power Level** is increased (usually at the end of each
gameplay session), characters improve as follows:

  - All stats have their rating increased by 1.
  - Then, the rating for Maximum Health is increased by 1 more.
  - Choose five stats to have their rating increased by 1 more. If
    Maximum Health is chosen, then it is increased by 2 instead of 1.
  - Choose one skill from each of the Skill Groups. Then choose ten
    other skills. These twenty skills all have their rating increased by
    1. If the skill started at 0, then there must be some explanation of
    how it was learned, trained, and practiced.

# 4\. Character Skills

To repeat from the [Player Characters](#player-characters) chapter:

  - For new characters: Choose one skill from each of the Skill Groups.
    Then choose ten other skills. These twenty skills all start with a
    rating of 1.
  - Upon increasing **Power Level**: Choose one skill from each of the
    Skill Groups. Then choose ten other skills. These twenty skills all
    have their rating increased by 1. If the skill started at 0, then
    there must be some explanation of how it was learned, trained, and
    practiced.

## Skill Categories and Skill Descriptions

  - **Armor Training Group**
      - **Unarmored** - Always have some basic protection, even while
        naked. However, you cannot gain the benefit of any magic that
        enhances armor or shields.
      - **Shields** - Use one hand to focus on protecting yourself.
      - **Light Armor**
      - **Heavy Armor**
      - **Magic Armor**
  - **Weapon Training Group**
      - **Barehanded** - You always have some basic attack power, but
        you also gain no benefits from anything that affects weapons,
        nor can you use weapon-based techniques. You end up relying on
        other kinds of techniques to get things done.
      - **One-Handed Melee Weapons**
      - **Two-Handed Melee Weapons**
      - **One-Handed Reach Weapons**
      - **Two-Handed Reach Weapons**
      - **One-Handed Ranged Weapons**
      - **Two-Handed Ranged Weapons**
  - **Magical Elements Group** - Used in combination with skills of the
    Magical Techniques Group. Dark and Light have no relation to good
    and evil - except in the Imperial Adtextus. Some of the most
    trustworthy, honest, and generous people are specialists of the
    Dark. Some of the worst people are specialists of the Light.
    Creatures of opposite elements do not necessarily hate each other.
    In fact they sometimes form symbiotic relationships.
      - **Air** - opposite of Earth
      - **Crystal** - not opposite to any other element
      - **Dark** - opposite of Light
      - **Earth** - opposite of Air
      - **Fire** - opposite of Water
      - **Light** - opposite of Dark
      - **Moon** - opposite of Wood
      - **Water** - opposite of Fire
      - **Wood** - opposite of Moon
  - **Magical Techniques Group** - Used in combination with skills of
    the Magical Elements Groups. All magical techniques must be used in
    association with one specific element. Available techniques are
    determined by the lowest of the element and technique skill. For
    example, one of the techniques from Elemental Techs rating 5 is
    Elemental Spark. Elemental Spark can only be used with elements if
    your skill in those elements is also at rating 5.
      - **Alchemy Techs** - Preparation and expert usage of items.
        However, you can only have a certain number of items prepared at
        a time, and when they all get used up, you must spend a
        **Strategic Turn** to prepare more.
      - **Cooking Techs** - Keeping people well-fed and giving them
        constant bonuses as a result of their diet. However, this set of
        techniques is not as interesting as the other technique skills
        during combat, instead being more of a source of passive
        bonuses.
      - **Elemental Techs** - Pure elemental power from the Blended
        Realm. These techniques can be energy and time intensive, but
        they also build up to great power.
      - **Hexenkraft Techs** - Magic pulled directly into people’s
        bodies, weapons, and armor. This is most often associated with
        immediate healing, but also has deeper intricacies and
        complexities.
      - **Martial Techs** - Channeling magic through one’s own body to
        create powerful fighting techniques. If you are both unarmed and
        unarmored, you will likely rely on Martial Techs heavily in
        combat.
      - **Musical Techs** - Reserves action points in order to create
        constant effects around yourself.
      - **Summoning Techs** - Temporary contracts with creatures from
        the Blended Realm.
      - **Weapon Melee Techs** - Forming magical power within one’s
        weapon.
      - **Weapon Ranged Techs** - Focusing magical power into
        projectiles.
  - **Artistic Group**
      - **Architecture: <Specific Style>**
      - **Dance Style: <Specific Style>**

      - **Locks**
      - **Metalworking**
      - **Nautical**
      - **Plants**
      - **Traps**
  - **Linear Tactics Group** - This group is based on forming straight
    battle lines. With these tactics, it is recommended to use least two
    lines: a front line for soaking damage and picking apart anyone who
    comes too close, and a rear line for damage output and support. This
    skill group is not contradictory with the **Zone Tactics Group**,
    and can in fact go well together, especially at higher skill
    ratings.
      - **Rampart Aura** - Blocking enemies from moving past you.
        Important for anyone who must hold the edge of a battle line.
      - **Shield Wall**
      - **Siegebreaker**
      - **Spear Wall**
      - **Volley Fire**
  - **Zone Tactics Group** - This group is based on forming separate
    circular battle groups who quickly move together and seek out weak
    enemy groups to break through. This skill group is not contradictory
    with the **Linear Tactics Group**, and can in fact go well together,
    especially at higher skill ratings.
      - **Animal Speaker Aura** - Communicate defensive maneuvers to
        allied animals.
      - **Barrier Aura** - Project a constant barrier to block physical
        attacks.

      - Crystal: Turns the terrain (or terrain-connected air) into
        transparent crystal.

# 5\. Dramatic Scenes

## Dramatic Chances

There are two options - the slow but steady way, or the risky way. The
slow and steady way is always guaranteed to accomplish anything that is
not time-sensitive. The risky way can gain an advantage in a later
situation, but of course can also result in disadvantages, injuries, or
even death. Some situations do not have the slow but steady way as an
option, e.g. running away from someone chasing you.

To do the risky way, the Game Master calls for a coin toss. The
character pursuing the risky way must call heads or tails, then flip a
coin. If the character guesses correctly, the risk pays-off and the
advantage is secured. Otherwise, on a wrong guess, a disadvantage
happens instead.

Some character skills, and other character-specific information, may
provide extra chances in specific situations. The players should also
cooperate to ensure that a variety of angles of attack are used to gain
extra chances.

Example:

  - Jane wants to sneak into a mansion.
  - John points out that Jane’s skillset includes a lot of Wood-based
    magic. Therefore she should try making the mansion itself open up to
    her.
  - Jane checks to see if the mansion is actually made of wood, by
    knocking on it, examining it with her Wood Magic, and other such
    actions.
  - The Game Master confirms that they had previously written the
    mansion as made of wood, including the exterior, the frame, the
    floor, and the doorways. Therefore the strategy of making the
    mansion itself open up to her should give her extra chances when
    infiltrating the risky way.

Example:

  - John tries to light a lantern in a pitch-black environment.
  - The Game Master had written that the environment was pitch-black due
    to Dark Magic. Therefore the Game Master says that lighting a
    lantern does not work.
  - Jane points out that John has an artifact of Light Magic.
  - The Game Master confirms that the artifact would indeed help to push
    back the Dark Magic, and therefore, John could break the artifact
    open to gain extra chances doing things the risky way.

### Skills Giving Extra Chances

Every 10th rating achieved in a skill provides one additional Dramatic
Chance when using that skill.

Example:

  - Jack wants to unlock a door as quickly as possible. Jack also has a
    Locks skill rating of 25. Therefore, Jack gets two extra chances to
    unlock the door.

### Increased Difficulty

Increased Difficulty is represented by requiring different types of
Dramatic Chances. I.E. difficult dramatic situations must be attacked
through multiple angles. This ensures that Dramatic Chances never come
down to just having as many chances as possible for exactly one type of
situation - but rather, that characters are rewarded for covering a
variety of situations.

Example:

  - The Game Master writes a situation in which the player-characters
    are trying to sneak into a secure mansion, in order to rob the
    contents of a masterwork safe.
  - Jane must succeed in sneaking into the mansion. Perhaps the Movement
    skill, under the Adventuring Group, can help here.
  - John must succeed in finding and disabling the darkness traps.
    Perhaps the Traps skill, under the Adventuring Group, can help here.
  - Jack must succeed in unlocking the safe. Perhaps the Locks skill,
    under the Adventuring Group, can help here.

# 6\. Island Rules

## Island Stats

### Inhabitants

**Animals** - They are unable to communicate with their Island in a way
that comes across as complete thoughts to other People, and they cannot
use tools, but they are nevertheless valued. They are usually used for
wool, milk, contributing to the island ecosystem, and other such
purposes.

**People** - Defined as everyone who is capable of communicating with
their Island, as well as using tools. With these two things, they can
then communicate directly, or use their Island as an intermediary.

The required development of Systems can be considered to be Animals +
People for core Systems, and just People for ones that require more tool
usage.

### Systems

**Automation** - Required by People to enable more of them to be
available for strategic actions.

**Island Health** - Required by all Inhabitants. Without it, Animals and
People get sick and die.

**Food System** - Required by all Inhabitants. 1 out of every 5 Animals
also provides 1 Food point, representing milk, honey, fertilizer, and
other things. In desperation, People might cause damage to the Island
Health to feed their hunger, at a ratio of 1 Island Health damage to
provide food for 5 People for one Strategic Turn. They can also
slaughter 1 point of Animals for a quick 1 point of food for that turn
only.

**Fortifications** - Required by all Inhabitants to participate in
effective defense against the Empire.

**Knowledge Permanency** - Required by People, or else they will lose
their ability to maintain everything else.

**Materials System** - Required by People, representing clothes, hand
tools, maintenance of shelter, etc.

**Shelter** - Required by People, can also be provided to Animals if
they do not naturally survive on the land.

**Water System** - Required by all Inhabitants. In desperation, People
might cause damage to the Island Health to slake their thirst, at a
ratio of 1 Island Health damage to provide water for 5 People for one
Strategic Turn.

### Special Constructs

These provide unique flavor. But because they are special, they can be
specifically targeted by the Empire, which would then result in the loss
of key pieces of other Systems.

Every Island should have at least a few. The process of writing them
should be considered part of the development of the culture and
character of the Island.

#### Example Special Constructs

  - **Cycle of Fire** - +20 Shelter. Every 10 years, a village must
    spend one year living completely without heating, and learn how to
    endure the cold. After this year of cold, an enemy person or
    building is set on fire to renew the cycle.
  - **Legend of the Peacemaker** - +20 Knowledge Permanency. The People
    of the Island were unified by someone who pacified and organized the
    tribal warlords, replacing their hatred and feuds with constructive
    social mechanisms.
  - **The Dangerous Dress Time** - +20 Fortifications. All People must
    spend some portion of their childhood guarding the edges of the
    Island, keeping watch for danger. During this time, they must also
    try out a variety of dresses, wigs, and other stylings which are
    normally associated with specific genders. The People undergoing
    this process are considered to be more powerful, due to being
    on-edge and forgoing the comforts of even their own genders.
  - **Wedding Warriors** - +20 Fortifications. During every ceremony of
    marriage between two people, warriors from each family must fight
    each other (with nonlethal weapons). Challengers may also come and
    challenge anyone. Stabbing is not allowed unless a blood feud
    between two warriors is recognized.

## Strategic Turns

1.  Calculation Phase
2.  Island Events Phase
3.  Imperial Actions Phase
4.  Island Actions Phase

### Calculation Phase

#### 1\. Island Health

Sick Animals and Sick People above the Island Health number are killed.

Healthy Animals and Healthy People above the Island Health number are
turned Sick.

#### 2\. Water System

Sick Animals and Sick People above the Water System number are killed.

Healthy Animals and Healthy People above the Water System rating are
turned Sick.

#### 3\. Food System

Every 5 Healthy Animals provide 1 Food point during this phase.

Sick Animals and Sick People above the Food System number are killed.

Healthy Animals and Healthy People above the Food System number are
turned Sick.

#### 4\. Shelter

Healthy Animals and Healthy People above the Shelter rating are turned
Sick.

#### 5\. Materials System

Every 100 Materials System matching to 100 Healthy People provides 1
Materials Power Action.

#### 6\. Knowledge Permanency

Every 100 Knowledge Permanency matching to 100 Healthy People provides 1
Knowledge Power Action.

#### 7\. Automation

Every 100 Automation matching to 100 Healthy People provides 1
Automation Power Action.

#### 8\. Fortification

Record the number of Animals and People who are not covered by
Fortification. These Animal and People can be enslaved or murdered by
the Empire before you are able to respond.

### Island Events Phase

### Imperial Actions Phase

Possible Imperial actions should make sense based on your island’s
starting situation, and everything you have done which the imperials
were able to identify as coming from your island. If your island has
sufficient Fortifications, then the effectiveness of Imperial Actions
should be halved, or even cut to one-fifth. And of course, venturing
forth to attack the Imperials directly will certainly reduce the number
of actions they can do in a Strategic Turn.

Generally, the Imperials start with 1 action per Strategic Turn, then
escalate from there, with no limit to the maximum number of actions once
they start sending full Legions. Eventually you will have to face the
Legions head-on in battle and kill their highest-ranked soldiers and
generals.

**Build Adtextus Banner**:

  - \-10 Island Health
  - An Imperial Senator conducts a ritual of life draining, then hammers
    an Adtextus Banner into the Island. Without sufficient
    Fortifications, no response is possible.

**Enslave People**:

  - \-5 Island Health
  - \-10 People
  - \-10 Knowledge Permanency
  - \-10 Automation
  - Auxilia or Legion Scouts quickly surround and grab people at night.
    Without sufficient Fortifications, no response is possible.

**Use Murder Squads**:

  - \-10 Island Health
  - \-10 Animals
  - \-10 Tribespeople
  - \-10 Knowledge Permanency
  - Auxilia with a reputation for murderousness are hired to land on the
    Island and do whatever they can. Without sufficient Fortifications,
    no response is possible.

**Divert River**:

  - \-10 Island Health
  - \-20 Water System
  - An Imperial Legion redirects a river so that it falls off the edge
    of the Island. This takes long enough that you can react to it, even
    without Fortifications. However, without sufficient Fortifications,
    you may not arrive until the Legion has started to pack up their
    digging tools.

**Salt the Earth**:

  - \-10 Island Health
  - \-20 Food System
  - An Imperial Legion marches across gardens and farmland on the
    Island, sewing salt and poison. This takes long enough that you can
    react to it, even without Fortifications. However, without
    sufficient Fortifications, you may not arrive until the Legion has
    salted at least half of their planned area.

**Burn Village**:

  - \-10 Island Health
  - \-5 Animals
  - \-5 People
  - \-10 Shelter
  - \-10 Materials System
  - \-10 Knowledge Permanency
  - \-10 Automation
  - An Imperial Legion forms a complete cordon around a village, and
    uses a combination of torches and burning arrows to destroy it all.
    This takes long enough that you can react to it, even without
    Fortifications. However, without sufficient Fortifications, you may
    not arrive until the fires have been set.

**Build Siege Engines**:

  - \-10 Island Health
  - \-20 Fortifications
  - An Imperial Legion builds and employs siege engines in order to
    shoot at the Island from a distance. This action cannot be
    interrupted unless you have external sky patrols, but it does result
    in the Legion having to hold still long enough for you to
    sally-forth or counterattack.

### Island Actions Phase

Each Player-Character can do one strategic action, of any kind.

There are also System Power Actions potentially obtained through the
Calculation Phase.

One out of every 100 people also have enough free time to do one Island
Development Action. The rest of the people are busy hunting, gathering,
harvesting, cooking, weaving, sewing, crafting, etc.

#### External

“External” covers all actions such as visiting distant islands,
infiltrating the Empire, doing battle against the Empire, doing anything
the island would not approve of, seeking out lost knowledge and wisdom,
shifting into the Blended Realm without the rest of the island, etc. If
this action type is chosen, then all Player-Characters should stick
together to do exactly one External action for the Strategic Turn.

Particularly-long quests will naturally take multiple Strategic Turns.
For example, journeying across the world to request aid from a different
island, or deliver an artifact.

#### System Power Action

# 7\. Combat

Combat has no random elements except for:

  - Turn Order
  - Techniques that explicitly have a random component

So, once turn order is resolved, you should be able to calculate how the
rest of the entire combat round could go.

## Battle Escalation and Energy

Battle Escalation starts at 0. Then at the beginning of each combat
round, it increases by 1.

Every combatant’s Energy starts at 0. It can be recharged through the
Charge Energy action, as well as through other specific means.

## Turn Order

Each combatant rolls three ten-sided dice and orders them in hundreds
place, then tens place, then ones place. If using an electronic system
to do the dice, then use 1d1000. Then, each combatant adds their Level
to the result. The turn order starts with the highest result, and goes
down from there.

In the case of a tie, the combatant with the higher Level goes first.

This is one of the only times that dice are ever used in the game.

## Actions

Each combatant gets four action points. The possible actions are:

  - Attack - 1 AP
  - Change Armor - 4 AP
  - Change Weapon - 2 AP
  - Charge Energy - 1 AP
  - Defend - 1 AP
  - Grapple - 2 AP
  - Move - 1 AP
  - Perform Technique - 1 AP (some techniques have different AP costs)
  - Use Item - 1 AP

### Attack

If the attacker’s accuracy is less than the target’s evasion, then the
target’s armor is applied a second time.

If the attacker’s accuracy is less than half of the target’s evasion,
then the attack or technique misses.

If the attacker’s accuracy is double or higher than the target’s
evasion, then the target’s armor is not applied, and the target is
knocked back by 5 feet.

### Change Armor

Changes which type of armor you are using.

### Change Weapon

Changes what you have in your hands.

### Charge Energy

The Charge Energy action restores Energy to yourself, equal to the
Battle Escalation number.

### Defend

The Defend action keeps your Physical Evasion, Magical Evasion and
Magical Armor up. Without at least one Defend action, these stats fall
down to equalling your Power Level instead.

Additional Defend actions in one round will each add an amount to your
Physical Evasion, Physical Armor, Magical Evasion, and Magical Armor
equal to half of their respective base ratings, until your next turn.

### Grapple

Similar to Attack, except the range is always 5 feet, the amount of
damage is always equal to 1/10th of the target’s Maximum Health, and a
successful action results in the target being moved 5 feet back. The
damage ignores Physical Armor.

Consequently, even the most well-armored soldiers must beware grapplers.

### Move

The standard movement type is Foot, providing 20 feet of horizontal
movement per Move Action. Maximum upwards jump is 2 feet. Maximum
horizontal jump is 5 feet. Maximum downwards jump is 4 feet. There are
other movement types, traits, statuses, etc. that can change this.

Horizontal jumps count against your horizontal movement. For example,
jumping across a 5-foot gap counts as using 5 feet of horizontal
movement.

Vertical jumps do not count against horizontal movement. For example,
moving into a 5-foot-square that is 5 feet lower in elevation is only
considered to be 5 feet of horizontal movement.

### Perform Technique

Most techniques only take 1 AP, and have other costs or limitations to
compensate. Some techniques, however, explicitly state that they take 2
or more AP, or otherwise reserve AP.

### Use Item

Item usage generally has a range of five feet.

## Movement Modifiers

**Foot** - The base movement type. 20 feet of horizontal movement per
Move Action. Maximum upwards jump is 2 feet. Maximum horizontal jump is
5 feet. Maximum downwards jump is 4 feet.

**Hover I** - You are constantly floating up to 1 foot above the
terrain. Falling damage is halved. Maximum horizontal jump is 10 feet.
Maximum downwards jump is 8 feet. - **Hover II** - You are constantly
floating up to 2 feet above the terrain. Falling damage is halved.
Maximum horizontal jump is 15 feet. Maximum downwards jump is 16 feet. -
**Hover III** - You are constantly floating up to 3 feet above the
terrain. Falling damage is halved. Maximum horizontal jump is 20 feet.
Maximum downwards jump is 24 feet. - **Hover IV** - You are constantly
floating up to 4 feet above the terrain. Falling damage is halved.
Maximum horizontal jump is 30 feet. Maximum downwards jump is 32 feet.

**Jump I** - Maximum upwards jump is 4 feet. Maximum horizontal jump is
10 feet. Maximum downwards jump is 6 feet. - **Jump II** - Maximum
upwards jump is 6 feet. Maximum horizontal jump is 15 feet. Maximum
downwards jump is 8 feet. - **Jump III** - Maximum upwards jump is 8
feet. Maximum horizontal jump is 20 feet. Maximum downwards jump is 10
feet. - **Jump IV** - Maximum upwards jump is 10 feet. Maximum
horizontal jump is 30 feet. Maximum downwards jump is 12 feet.

**Mudwalking** - Move on top of mud, swamp, and mold as if it were
normal. Not affected by swamp, mold, and other such terrain.

**Swiftfoot I** - 25 feet of horizontal movement per Move Action. -

## Special Circumstances

Falling damage is equal to 2 points for each foot beyond your maximum
downwards jump distance. Falling off the edge of a flying Island is
quite a lot of damage. Note that various movement types also state that
they halve falling damage. With multiple such movement types, each one
further halves the remaining falling damage, so it can be cut to 1/4th,
1/8th, 1/16th, and so on.

**Example 1:** A combatant is pushed by 5 feet, and ends up falling 20
feet. Their maximum downwards jump is 4 feet. So they take 16 \* 2, or
32, points of falling damage. This is lethal to Power Level 1 combatants
without some way to halve it, and still hurts quite a lot to more
powerful combatants.

half your Power Level to your Physical Evasion.

# 8\. World Details

## Temporary Allies

All possible allies described here are explicitly “temporary”. They will
inevitably find excuses to cease helping you for some reason or another.

### Unpaid Legions

They object to the fact that the Patrician class controls them, but they
think everything else about the Empire and Adtextus are fine. They
merely want to ensure that the Senate is abolished and the Emperor is
always a representative of the Legions. Getting an Unpaid Legion to
realize that anything else is wrong is very difficult, since they are
still able to use their Imperial equipment, training, and the
life-draining power of the Adtextus to feel good about dominating
others. They may openly state that they are allied with you in order to
gain trust with other Islands, or to gain access to your food and water,
but they will always criticize people who do not fit their version of
the Adtextus.

### Exoticist Senators

These Senators think the Adtextus is too destructive to other cultures,
but they see nothing wrong with the Empire continuing to take over
everything. They merely want to change the Adtextus, or put Islands into
Density Camps to be gawked at.

They will give you Imperial food and money to entertain them, or even
small pieces of land on their continent, but nothing else. They
especially will not play their power games to advance your interests, as
that would be “uncivil”, despite the fact that they already play their
power games all the time to enrich themselves in other ways. If you tell
them that perhaps they should think of you as thinking living beings,
then they will get angry and call you “ungrateful”.

### Other Superpowers

The other superpowers are nowhere near your Island, and aspire to take
over the world themselves. What they lack in the life-draining Adtextus
and the brutality of the Legions, they make up for in their own ways.
For example, one superpower might still have a strictly hierarchical
ideology magic that causes harm, but it may use a lot more human blood
sacrifice and cause a lot less damage to the land. Another superpower
might allow Islands to retain their culture, but the Islands are
obligated to give their most strong and beautiful people to suffer
indignities until they die of pain and despair.

## The Imperial Adtextus

The Imperial Adtextus has been engineered over time to maintain a strict
and inflexible hierarchical structure. Its driving principles are
inherently wrong. All attempts to add new words to it will only result
in the new words being corrupted by those principles. Even before the
Adtextus was codified, the Empire was still relying heavily on
life-draining magic. But now it has grown into its own beast, which not
even Emperors can control.

It is the foundation for the magic that the Empire uses to enforce its
own existence. It grants Imperials the ability to drain energy from
others, and absorbs elemental power to strengthen buildings, weapons,
and armor. There is nothing mysterious or secret about it. All Imperial
scholars know exactly when it was founded, how, and by whom. In fact, it
metes out the Imperial sense of time itself, down to the smallest
fractions of a second. The first scholars who wrote it down are revered
as great philosophers, although still mortal.

It is spread through the following means:

  - Monuments to the Empire, with portions of the Adtextus written upon
    them. These monuments are activated with religious rituals.
  - Orators constantly reciting the Adtextus in public. Their own life
    force is burned in order to perform energy transfers on all who can
    hear them.
  - Slaves having their hearts ripped out in religious rituals. Their
    life force is transferred to the shared energy field of the
    Adtextus.
  - Patricians organizing their estates in accordance with the Adtextus.
    The Adtextus then shoots magical effects at the estates to
    accelerate the energy transfers.

Examples of the Adtextus:

  - Correct Order - Something must always be on top, taking from
    everything under it. Any surplus must be used to reinforce and
    expand this hierarchy. This is the foundational principle of the
    Adtextus, which all other Imperial magic relies on. If this
    principle were altered or removed, then all current Imperial magic
    would cease to function.
  - Center of the Universe - The Imperial Palace, which the Emperor is
    required to administrate from. Before the Adtextus was established,
    it was called the “Middle House”.
  - Bio Cutting Resource - Person in the military. It is expected that
    all people gendered male who are ages 15 to 35 will serve in the
    military. Those who do not are considered weak, and relegated to the
    lowest work possible. Those who prove themselves may have a chance
    to become a proper Legionary, and thereby gain land and slaves at
    the end of their service. In fact much Imperial conquest is solely
    for the purpose of delivering these promises to their Legions. The
    Adtextus itself is used to repress the minds of those who are
    unpaid, and consequently would consider desertion or even rebellion,
    although the schemes of the Patricians may exploit such disgruntled
    Legions.
  - Dirt Cutting Resource - Person who works outside the house and is
    not in the military. All people gendered male who are age 36 or
    older are expected to work until death. Those who were not fortunate
    enough to be a Legionary and/or get paid must wander around,
    constantly begging for work or even food. The Adtextus itself tries
    to twist their minds towards volunteering for slavery, making them
    believe that at least then they would have consistent food and
    drink.
  - Bio Assembly Resource - A person gendered woman who conforms to
    precise standards of appearance, and who has been proven to have
    birthed children. Women are legally owned by their fathers until
    they are sold to their husbands. Violence against women is only
    considered harmful so far as it affects the man’s property. A few
    women have played the power games at the Patrician level, although
    the Adtextus ensures they are perceived as evil witches and rewrites
    all imperial records of their deeds.
  - Bio Consumption Resources - A narrowly-defined set of plants,
    animals, and drinks that are considered high-class imperial food.
    All other food is defined as unclean and disgusting. Of course, the
    plants and animals only thrive within specific regions, and do
    poorly in others, causing the Empire to consider those other regions
    barren wastes. Imperial agricultural practices also deplete the soil
    and cause it to erode within decades, so the heartlands of the
    Empire are already barren by their definition. The heartlands only
    produce grain and wine today because of life energy drained from
    slaves - and it takes the lives of more and more slaves each year to
    maintain the current mode of production.
  - Unweighted Warrior - A term that was added by Emperor Decimus, in an
    effort to prevent the Adtextus from killing the St’los Tribe. So,
    instead of killing the tribe, it just mutated them into their
    current infamous forms. Emperor Decimus had to issue proclamations
    that the St’los Tribe was always that way, and that it was a mistake
    to take them on as military auxiliaries in the first place. Then he
    ordered the tribe to be decimated, for their failure to live up to
    expectations.
  - Deep Grass - A term that was added by Emperor Livius, in an effort
    to allow crops that would grow in Yurk Province without destroying
    the topsoil. But, due to the way the Adtextus was designed, it
    changed the grass itself to deplete the soil rather than replenish
    it, because the Adtextus does not allow anything from the Empire to
    give back to anything else. Emperor Livius proceeded to have many of
    his scholars publicly-executed for their failure, because the
    Adtextus only allows punishment to flow downwards.

## Intentionally Unanswered Questions

Who is the current Emperor? Is this person putting any effort whatsoever
into reforming the Empire or modifying the Adtextus? But even if they
did put in such effort, the Adtextus itself has a foundation that would
only allow the Emperor to change the flavor or speed of various
processes. Any Emperor who would destroy the Adtextus must accept that
unless the Imperials themselves switch to a different way of life, they
will surely die from the removal of the Adtextus.

Who are the St’los Tribe? What horrific fate befell them as a result of
being classified as “Unweighted Warriors”? Are they anywhere near your
Island?

What is Yurk Province? How is it doing after the failed experiment with
Deep Grass? Is it anywhere near your own Island? Who were the people who
used to live in it, or who currently survive in it?

Is there any kind of grand civilization in the Blended Realm? If so,
then what would be their aims towards the solid world?

Is the Empire actually close to division and collapse? If so, then are
the other Islands looking to conquer yours? Will they establish an
Adtextus of their own to just make another evil regime with their own
special characteristics? Perhaps the dreaded Savage Wolf Tribe could be
the one to overthrow the Empire, and replace it with raw violence all
the time?
